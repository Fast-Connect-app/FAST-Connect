# FAST Connect: A Centralized Online Community for FAST Students and Alumni

## üöÄ Project Proposal

### **Title**
**FAST Connect**: A Centralized Online Community for FAST Students and Alumni

---

### **Scope**
FAST Connect aims to develop an interactive online platform exclusively for students and alumni of FAST University. Currently, communication is fragmented across various platforms like WhatsApp, Discord, and subreddits. This platform seeks to centralize these interactions, offering features such as:

- Job referrals and tips.
- Skill development opportunities.
- Query resolution.
- A searchable repository of study materials.

While the platform is initially focused on FAST, it is designed with scalability in mind to include students and alumni from other universities in the future. The platform will focus on community interaction, professional networking, and knowledge sharing, excluding internal university-specific systems like grading portals.

---

### **Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to build a unified online community where students and alumni can:

- Connect and interact across different campuses.
- Share job referrals, enhancing career opportunities.
- Provide and access a searchable repository of study materials.
- Exchange knowledge via public threads and private messages (DMs).
- Build a scalable platform to include other universities in the future.

---

### **Problem Statement**
Currently, students and alumni are scattered across multiple platforms such as WhatsApp, Discord, and subreddits, leading to:

- Missed opportunities for collaboration and networking.
- Limited avenues for alumni to offer mentorship or job referrals.
- Difficulty in locating study materials and asking questions.

**FAST Connect** solves these problems by consolidating all communication (public and private) into a single platform, fostering a stronger and more interactive university community.
